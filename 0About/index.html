        <h1>Dear Data Seminar</h1>
        <h2>UC Berkeley, Stat 24, Spring 2021</h2>


        <div class="content">
            <p>
                This freshman seminar was inspired by the year-long drawing <a href="http://www.dear-data.com/theproject">project</a> between Giorgia Lupi and Stafanie Posavec,
                two award-winning information designers. Each week, they collected data about their lives and translated them into
                a hand-drawn visualization that they mailed to each other. They discovered that their personal documentary helped
                them slow down and appreciate the small details in their lives and to connect with others on a deeper level. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this seminar, students read Lupi and Posavec’s book of 104 postcards and carried out their own data collection and
                drawing.Hopefully, the Dear Data project helped students see the world with a new appreciation where anything can be
                a creative starting point.
